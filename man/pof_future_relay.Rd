)
}
\arguments{
\item{simulation_end_year}{Numeric. The last year of simulating probability
of failure. Default is 100.}
}
\value{
Numeric. Current probability of failure
per annum
}
\description{
This function calculates the future
annual probability of failure relay.
The function is a cubic curve that is based on
the first three terms of the Taylor series for an
exponential function.
