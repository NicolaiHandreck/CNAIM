\arguments{
\item{foundation_type}{String. Foundation type of the tower
\code{foundation_type = c("Foundation - Fully Encased Concrete",
 "Foundation - Earth Grillage")}}

\item{paint_type}{String. Paint type of the tower
\code{foundation_type = c(Paint System - Galvanising, Paint System - Paint )}}

\item{placement}{String. Specify if the asset is located outdoor or indoor.}

\item{number_of_operations}{Numeric Number of operations for the tower}

\item{altitude_m}{Numeric. Specify the altitude location for
the asset measured in meters from sea level.\code{altitude_m}
is used to derive the altitude factor. A setting of \code{"Default"}
will set the altitude factor to 1 independent of \code{asset_type}.}

\item{distance_from_coast_km}{Numeric. Specify the distance from the
coast measured in kilometers. \code{distance_from_coast_km} is used
to derive the distance from coast factor.
A setting of \code{"Default"} will set the
 distance from coast factor to 1 independent of \code{asset_type}.}

\item{corrosion_category_index}{Integer.
Specify the corrosion index category, 1-5.}

\item{age}{Numeric. The current age in years of the conductor.}

\item{observed_condition_inputs_steelwork}{Named list observed_conditions_input}

\item{observed_condition_inputs_paint}{Named list observed_conditions_input}

\item{observed_condition_inputs_foundation}{Named list observed_conditions_input
\code{conductor_samp = c("Low","Medium/Normal","High","Default")}.}

\item{reliability_factor}{Numeric. \code{reliability_factor}
shall have a value between 0.6 and 1.5. A setting of \code{"Default"}
 sets the \code{reliability_factor} to 1.
See section 6.14 on page 73 in CNAIM (2021).}

\item{k_value}{Numeric. \code{k_value = 0.0545} by default. This number is
given in a percentage. The default value is accordingly to the CNAIM standard
on p. 110.}

\item{c_value}{Numeric. \code{c_value = 1.087} by default.
The default value is accordingly to the CNAIM standard see page 110}

\item{normal_expected_life}{Numeric. \code{normal_expected_life = "Default"} by default.
The default value is accordingly to the CNAIM standard on page 107.}

\item{simulation_end_year}{Numeric. The last year of simulating probability
of failure. Default is 100.}

\value{
Numeric array. Future probability of failure
per annum for Towers OHL support 50 kV.
}
\description{
This function calculates the future
annual probability of failure per kilometer for a towers OHL support 50 kV.
The function is a cubic curve that is based on
the first three terms of the Taylor series for an
exponential function.
